# color-palette-app

## Description:
The Color Palette application is designed to ease the process of narrowing down what hex codes are necessary to achieve an complementary, triadic, or monochromatic
color schemes. Choosing a color through the color selector presents you with the hex code for that color as well as three rows representing all of the color schemes and the associated hex codes. This project was built because of the necessity to provide a polished UI and easy access to achieve any of the included color schemes with every available hex code. This project helps to solve several problems. Users will find it easier to choose what colors to apply to their code. A monochromatic color scheme provides high contrast between colors allowing individuals with vision impairments better accessibility. During this project we learned the usefulness of implementing bootstrap into a project and how it can accelerate the development process. We also gained experience commiting and pulling to git and resolving any resulting merge conflcts. Finally, we were able to implement and reinforce our html, css, and javascript skills.
